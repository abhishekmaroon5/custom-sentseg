# Custom Sentence Segmentation

This repository contains a customizable sentence segmentation codebase tailored for specific use cases. Traditional sentence segmentation tools often fail on domain-specific texts or noisy data. This project provides a framework to build and train your own sentence segmentation model.

## Features

*   **Customizable:** Easily adapt the model to your specific domain and data.
*   **Trainable:** Train your own sentence segmentation models.
*   **Extensible:** The modular design allows for easy extension and experimentation with different models and techniques.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-sentseg.git
    cd custom-sentseg
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file)*

## Usage

### Data Preparation

To train a custom model, you need to prepare your data. Describe the expected data format here.

### Training

To train a new model, you can use a script like this:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
```

### Inference

To perform sentence segmentation on a text file:

```bash
python segment.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --input_file /path/to/input.txt --output_file /path/to/output.txt
```

## Configuration

The project can be configured using YAML files located in a `configs/` directory. This allows you to specify model architecture, training parameters, and data paths.
