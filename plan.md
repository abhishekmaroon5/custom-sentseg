# Project Plan: Custom Sentence Segmentation

This document outlines the steps to build and train a custom sentence segmentation model.

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Create project directory structure (`data/`, `src/`, `models/`, `configs/`, `notebooks/`).
- [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file.
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies.

## 2. Dataset
- [ ] Identify and download a suitable dataset for sentence segmentation.
- [ ] Write a script to preprocess the dataset.
- [ ] Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- [ ] Define the data format for training.

## 3. Model Development
- [ ] Choose a model architecture (e.g., BiLSTM-CRF, or a Transformer-based model).
- [ ] Implement the model in `src/model.py`.
- [ ] Implement the data loader in `src/dataset.py`.

## 4. Training
- [ ] Create a training script `train.py`.
- [ ] Implement the training loop, loss calculation, and optimization.
- [ ] Log training metrics.
- [ ] Save model checkpoints.

## 5. Inference
- [ ] Create an inference script `segment.py`.
- [ ] Load a trained model and perform sentence segmentation on new text.

## 6. Evaluation
- [ ] Create an evaluation script `evaluate.py`.
- [ ] Compute metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score on the test set.

## 7. Configuration
- [ ] Use a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) to manage model and training parameters.
