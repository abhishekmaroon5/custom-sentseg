68. The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens. One of the key components of this system is the adaptive immune response, which involves the activation of lymphocytes. T cells and B cells are the primary types of lymphocytes, each playing a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign invaders. The process of antigen presentation is essential for the activation of T cells, where antigen-presenting cells (APCs) display fragments of pathogens on their surface using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This interaction triggers a cascade of cellular events leading to the proliferation and differentiation of T cells, ultimately resulting in the targeted destruction of infected cells.
